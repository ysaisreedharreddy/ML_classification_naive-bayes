Naive Bayes Classifier for Social Network Ads
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of the Naive Bayes algorithm for a classification task using a dataset of social network advertisements. It aims to predict user behavior towards ads based on user demographics (age and estimated salary).

Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Includes feature scaling to normalize the dataset features.
Naive Bayes Classification: Utilizes the Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict whether a user will purchase a product advertised on a social network.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates the model using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.

Features
Data Visualization: Includes visualizations of the dataset's features to understand data distribution and relationships.
Model Training and Prediction: Demonstrates how to train a Naive Bayes classifier and make predictions.
Model Evaluation: Uses accuracy, bias, variance, and a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

Technologies Used
Python: The project is implemented using Python.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For plotting graphs for data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Usage
The script will process the data from the Social_Network_Ads.csv file, train the Naive Bayes model, and print out the accuracy, bias, variance, and confusion matrix to the console.
